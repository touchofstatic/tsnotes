> You don’t need to write TypeScript code in your Astro projects to benefit from it. Astro always treats your component code as TypeScript,
and the Astro VS Code Extension will infer as much as it can to provide autocompletion, hints, and errors in your editor.

> Astro starter projects include a tsconfig.json file in your project. Even if you don’t write TypeScript code, 
this file is important so that tools like Astro and VS Code know how to understand your project. 
Some features (like npm package imports) aren’t fully supported in the editor without a tsconfig.json file. 
If you install Astro manually, be sure to create this file yourself.

## "implicitly has type 'any'"

Solution 1: add `: any` to the problem element

```
const { headings } = Astro.props;
---
headings.map((heading: any) => ()
```

Solution 2:

tsconfig.json
```
"compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": false
```

<span is-="badge" class="alert">ALERT:</span>
It's recommended to always have `"strict": true`.
`noImplicitAny` is one of the six strict mode flags.
You can disable any option that you don’t like from the strict family.

> **The most important flags** are `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks`.

> Because the type `any` basically disables type check, (...)
by using noImplicitAny, you will only have `any` where you explicitly use it.

## "is possibly 'null'"

Optional-chaining operator `?`:

```
const menuBtn = document.getElementById("menu-btn");
const menu = document.getElementById("menu");

menuBtn?.addEventListener("click", () => {
    menu?.classList.toggle("open");
});
```

## "does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'"

> This error occurs because you're trying to access a property of a specific type of HTMLElement but the document.getElementById() returns the most generic type: HTMLElement.

> To fix this error, you can use type assertion by using the `as` operator

```
    const radio1 = document.getElementById("radio-1") as HTMLInputElement;
    radio1.checked = true;
```
