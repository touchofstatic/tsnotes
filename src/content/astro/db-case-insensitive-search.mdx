title: 'db: case insensitive search'
---

(01/05/25) Drizzle ORM does not support ilike (value is like some other value, case insensitive)
for SQlite.

> Turso is the company behind libSQL, the open-source fork of SQLite that powers Astro DB.

```
let nocase = await db
    .select()
    .from(Author)
    .where(eq(Author.name, `${name}`).append(sql` COLLATE NOCASE`));
```
