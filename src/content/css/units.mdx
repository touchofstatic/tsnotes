Relative length units -- are based on font, container, or viewport sizes

| `em` | its parent's font size (used in `font-size`); otherwise its own font size |
| `rem` | its root's font size |
| `vh` | viewport's height. 1vh = 1% of vp height |
| `vw` | viewport's width. 1vw = 1% of vp width |
|     | ...and more! |

Intristic size -- html elements have a natural size set before they're altered by css

Extrinsic size -- size that's actively added

## em and rem

**Most popular** rel length units that are **super important** to understand!!!!

nested \<li> `1.3em` -> get progressively larger from \<html> to parent to parent

nested \<li> `1.3rem` -> get equally larger once from \<html>

## percentage

% resolve against containing block's size.

<span is-="badge" class="caution">CAUTION:</span> When using a percentage you need to be aware what it is a percentage of.
Furthermore, % margin and padding is calculated from **inline size**, even when applied to height.
