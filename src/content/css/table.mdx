## Inconsistent behavior and overflow problems

Try `table-layout: fixed`

- solve overflow problems
- ellipsis, scroll, and hide overflow
- image and code block width
- uniform height and width
- easy to control

```
table {
  table-layout: fixed;
}
```

Cells' parameters are based on the first row
