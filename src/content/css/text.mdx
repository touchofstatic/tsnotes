## font-size, font-family, font-style, font-weight

| - | - |
| --- | --- |
| `px` | pixels |
| `em` | its parent's font size |
| `rem` | its root's font size |

Instristic `font-size` of an element is inherited from that element's parent element. 
`<html>` has instristic `font-size: 16px`.

<span is-="badge" class="caution">CAUTION:</span> Avoid setting the `font-size` of container elements where possible

`font-family` --  font/list of fonts aka *font stack* to apply in order

`font-style`  -- italic. values are italic, normal, oblique (fake italic that's just slanted normal). `font-weight` - bold. many values available 

## How to space apart lines

`line-height` -- Unitless value acts as a multiplier of `font-size`.
Usually 1.5 – 2 (double spaced)


## Web fonts


### How to add a web font

1. Find web font
2. Generate the code using Webfont Generator or fontsqirrel.
You receive: woff and woff2, demo html, stylesheet.css with generated `@font-face` code
3. Put `@font-face` at the top of your css
4. Make sure in `@font-face` url() paths to font files are correct
5. Use these fonts in your font stacks!

### Online font services

Online font services store and serve fonts for you 
so you don't have to worry about writing the `@font-face` code

1. Get font
2. Get embed coode
3. Paste it into html in head above the css link element

### @font-face

font-family is the name YOU WANT TO REFER TO THE FONT AS

> The order in which you list font files is important.
> the browser will choose the first font file it's able to use. 
> That's why the format you list first should be the preferred format —
> that is, WOFF2 — with the older formats listed after that. 

## Variable fonts

### How to add a variable font

The same way as a web font

### Variation axis

Variation axis -- the allowable range of an aspect of typeface design. Can be range or binary

Registered --  weight, width, slant, italic, optical size. : existing css atrributes

Custom -- infinite. identified by four-letter axes tags (weight = "wght"). stuff like "yeast"

**AXIS NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE**. registered - lower case. custom - upper case
```
font-variation-settings:
  "wght" 375,
  "GRAD" 88;
```

`font-variation-settings` property uses the tag as part of a key-value pair.
`font-variation-settings: "wght" 350;`

<span is-="badge" class="caution">CAUTION:</span> 
`font-variation-settings` is lower-level syntax and the first mechanism implemented to test the early implementations of variable font support. 
W3C's intent was for this syntax not to be used when other attributes are available.
You should only use `font-variation-settings` as a last resort, 
if there is no appropriate basic attribute.

Font characteristics set using `font-variation-settings` 
**will always override** those set using the corresponding basic font properties, 
e.g. `font-weight`, **no matter where they appear in the cascade**.

### weight, width, italic, slant, optical size

1. `wght` = `font-weight`. [1; 1000] step 1

in static and variable: [100; 900] step 100; keywords "normal" = 400, "bold" = 700

```
font-weight: 375;
font-variation-settings: "wght" 375;
```

2. `wdth` = `font-stretch`. [50%; 200%]

<span is-="badge" class="caution">CAUTION:</span> `font-stretch` property is deprecated

3. `ital` = `font-style`: italic; 0 not italic, 0.5 half italic, 1 full italic. 

```
font-style: italic;
font-variation-settings: "ital" 1;
font-synthesis: none; // prevent browsers from accidentally applying the variation axis and a synthesized italic
```

Often has completely different letterforms

4. `slnt` = `font-style`: oblique + angle; [-90°; 90°]

```
font-style: oblique 14deg;
font-variation-settings: "slnt" -14;
```

5. `opsz` = `font-optical-sizing`. auto, none, num

```
font-optical-sizing: auto;
font-variation-settings: "opsz" 36;
```

Optical sizing - thiccness of letters optimized for viewing at different physical sizes.
New in css! 

Automatially applied based on `font-size`. In most cases you want that.
The option to provide a specific value is provided is when necessary to override the default 

### Compatibility

Variable font support can be checked with CSS Feature Queries (`@supports`)

```
h1 {
  font-family: some-non-variable-font-family;
}

@supports (font-variation-settings: "wdth" 115) {
  h1 {
    font-family: some-variable-font-family;
  }
}
```

## Best practices

Provide a suitable generic font name at the end of the font stack

Body text generally looks nicer and is easier to read when the lines are spaced apart

Declare separate font family entries as one font with family with respective style/weight values,
instead of declaring per italic/bold variation file
